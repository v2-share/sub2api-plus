<!-- readme-section:notice -->
## Important Notice

Sub2API Plus is an independently maintained community fork of Sub2API. It is
not an official upstream release and does not imply upstream affiliation,
endorsement, support, or trademark permission.

- Using subscription accounts through a gateway may conflict with provider
  terms. Review the applicable agreements before deployment.
- Deployers are responsible for legal, privacy, security, and operational
  compliance.
- The project is provided without warranty under LGPL-3.0-or-later.

<!-- readme-section:overview -->
## Overview

Sub2API Plus distributes and manages access to supported AI providers through
platform-issued API keys. It provides authentication, billing, account
scheduling, quota controls, auditing, and request forwarding.

<!-- readme-section:features -->
## Features

- Multiple OAuth and API-key account types
- User API-key and group management
- Token-level usage and billing
- Account scheduling, failover, and session affinity
- Quotas, subscriptions, redemption codes, and payment integrations
- OpenAI-, Claude-, and Gemini-compatible gateway interfaces
- Operational monitoring, audit, and security controls
- Optional simple mode for individual or internal deployments

Simple mode uses `RUN_MODE=simple`. Production also requires
`SIMPLE_MODE_CONFIRM=true`.

<!-- readme-section:quick-start -->
## Quick Start

### Linux binary lifecycle

The installer supports fresh installation, version pinning or rollback, and
uninstallation. Published binary tags use the immutable `vX.Y.Z-fork.N`
format on this fork; the upstream Plus line uses `vX.Y.Z+custom.NNN`.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v2-share/sub2api-plus/main/deploy/install.sh | sudo bash
```

List published versions:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v2-share/sub2api-plus/main/deploy/install.sh | bash -s -- list-versions
```

Install or switch to an exact published version. The command below is directly
usable; replace its immutable tag with another value returned by
`list-versions` when needed:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v2-share/sub2api-plus/main/deploy/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- install --version 'v0.2.4-fork.2'
```

Roll back an existing binary installation to an earlier published version:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v2-share/sub2api-plus/main/deploy/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- rollback 'v0.2.4-fork.1'
```

Remove the service and binary while preserving `/etc/sub2api`:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v2-share/sub2api-plus/main/deploy/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- uninstall --yes
```

Also remove `/etc/sub2api`. Review backups first; this cannot be undone:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v2-share/sub2api-plus/main/deploy/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- uninstall --yes --purge
```

Then open `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080` and complete the setup wizard.

### Nginx reverse-proxy notes

When Nginx runs on the same host, bind Sub2API to `127.0.0.1` and configure
only the Nginx peer under `server.trusted_proxies`. Nginx must overwrite, not
append, client-IP headers. Preserve streaming and WebSocket traffic with HTTP/1.1
upgrade headers, disabled proxy buffering, long read/send timeouts, and no gzip
for `text/event-stream`.

For Codex CLI or CRS-compatible clients, add this directive to the Nginx
`http` block:

```nginx
underscores_in_headers on;
```

Current Codex clients use the hyphenated `session-id`; legacy Codex/CRS-compatible
clients may still send `session_id`. Nginx drops underscore headers by default,
so keep this directive to preserve sticky session routing for those clients.
Validate the complete configuration before reloading:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

After the configuration test succeeds, reload Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Use the complete [Nginx baseline and trusted-proxy guidance](deploy/EDGE_SECURITY.md)
before exposing the service publicly.

| Antigravity | Dedicated and optional hybrid Claude/Gemini routing |
| Grok / xAI | OAuth subscription and API-key accounts |
| Asynchronous images | Submit and poll long-running image generation/edit tasks |
| Sora | Temporarily unavailable; do not depend on it in production |

<!-- readme-release-format:vX.Y.Z+custom.NNN|vX.Y.Z-custom.NNN|vX.Y.Z-fork.N -->
## Release and Image Tags

Fork releases use the following formats (the upstream Plus line uses
`vX.Y.Z+custom.NNN` / `X.Y.Z+custom.NNN`):

```text
Git/GitHub: vX.Y.Z-fork.N
Application: X.Y.Z-fork.N
GHCR:        ghcr.io/v2-share/sub2api-plus:vX.Y.Z-fork.N
```

Pin the immutable GHCR version tag for reproducible production deployments.
`latest` is a moving convenience tag. See [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) for the
upstream mapping and [the release process](docs/RELEASING.md) for maintainer
rules.
