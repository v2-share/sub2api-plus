  Safely push Sub2API Plus working branches and submit the final locally
  validated pull request. Use when the user asks to push code, publish the
  current branch, run the repository validation matrix, create or update a
  pull request, or verify branch CI. Ordinary push is fast and never runs the
  local matrix. submit-pr is the only final promotion boundary: its default
  full profile requires the latest default-branch base, runs every check inside
  the platform validation container, binds the result to exact base/head SHAs,
  pushes, publishes the local-validation commit status, and creates or reuses
  the pull request. The release-finalization profile is reserved for
  release-cli and requires a verified tag plus an exactly regenerated metadata
  tree. Never push the repository default branch.

# Push CLI

Run commands from the repository root:

    python3 skills/push-cli/scripts/push_cli.py push
    python3 skills/push-cli/scripts/push_cli.py submit-pr
    python3 skills/push-cli/scripts/push_cli.py check
    python3 skills/push-cli/scripts/push_cli.py check --serial
    python3 skills/push-cli/scripts/push_cli.py ensure
    python3 skills/push-cli/scripts/push_cli.py watch

`push` performs an authenticated exact-ref push of the clean current working
branch. It does not probe a container runtime, run local tests, create a pull
request, or wait for Actions. It rejects the GitHub default branch, detached
HEAD, unfinished Git operations, an unexpected remote, and every force/tag/all
push form.

`submit-pr` is the final promotion action. Its default `full` profile fetches
the current GitHub default branch, requires that commit to be contained by the
candidate branch, records the exact base and head, and runs the complete local
matrix inside the platform validation container. After the matrix it refetches
the default branch and requires the worktree, base, and head to be unchanged.
It then pushes the exact head, publishes the profile-specific
`sub2api/local-validation=success`, and creates or reuses one pull request to
the default branch.

`release-cli finalize` alone invokes `submit-pr --profile
release-finalization --tag <tag>`. That path requires the deterministic branch,
regenerates the complete expected tree from the recorded base, and verifies the
already published Release and immutable assets. It does not start the full
application matrix; the focused tree validation still runs in the platform
validation container. Treat the profile and tag as implementation
inputs; do not use them to accelerate an ordinary or release-candidate PR.

`check` runs the same full local matrix without pushing or creating a PR. It
uses bounded parallel lanes by default; `check --serial` preserves the original
ordering for diagnosis and same-commit timing comparisons. Both modes run the
same command and test set. `ensure` only prepares the platform runtime and
validation image. `watch` observes push-triggered Actions for the current
branch and SHA.

## Mandatory GitHub CLI Gate

Every action requires an installed and authenticated GitHub CLI. Resolve the
origin repository exactly as `v2-share/sub2api-plus`, verify repository
access and push permission, and resolve the default branch from GitHub. Never
run `gh auth login` automatically or fall back to another credential or HTTP
client.

Before an authorized push, configure Git transport with `gh auth setup-git`.
Git transfers only `HEAD:<current-branch>`. Never use `--force`, `--all`,
`--tags`, or another local ref.

## Validation Runtime

Only `check`, `submit-pr`, and `ensure` access the validation runtime.

- macOS: Apple Containers only; no Docker, Colima, or host-toolchain fallback.
- Windows: Docker inside a running WSL2 Debian or Ubuntu distribution only.
- Linux: directly reachable Docker Engine and Compose plugin.

Every full-profile Go, frontend, Python policy, installer, and lifecycle check
runs inside `deploy/Dockerfile.validation`. Host processes may only perform
GitHub/Git gates, runtime probes, image management, Compose parsing, or container
launch. Focused release metadata and deterministic finalization checks use the
same container environment; there is no host-validation exception.
After every container validation attempt, push-cli relies on `--rm` to remove
the one-shot container and its writable snapshot. It retains only the current
deterministic project validation image and dependency-cache generation, and
removes stale Sub2API validation generations. Cleanup is mandatory on success
and failure and never invokes a global prune that could affect unrelated
projects or runtime resources.

## Pull-Request Proof

The PR body contains one machine-readable typed marker and its head commit
carries the profile-specific `sub2api/local-validation` status description.
`full` binds base/head and forbids a tag. `release-finalization` binds
base/head/tag. A later branch commit has no matching status; a later
default-branch update no longer matches the marker. Either condition requires
another `submit-pr`; never edit the marker or status manually.

`submit-pr` creates a ready PR by default. `--title` and `--body-file` may
provide reviewed PR text. If exactly one open PR already exists for the same
head/base, update only its validation marker. Refuse ambiguous PRs or mismatched
head/base SHAs.

## Safety

- Never push the repository default branch, a dirty worktree, detached HEAD,
  or an unfinished merge/rebase/cherry-pick/revert.
- Never imply that ordinary `push` performed local validation.
- Never publish a success status until the post-matrix base/head/worktree
  recheck and exact branch push both succeed.
- Never request `release-finalization` outside release-cli or accept it without
  exact deterministic-tree and published-release verification.
- Never create a PR for a stale default-branch base.
- Never run the matrix on the host or silently downgrade tool versions.
- Treat a local validation failure as a hard stop before push or PR mutation.

Read `references/push-cli.md` for the exact matrix, proof format, and recovery
rules. Use `scripts/push_cli.py` for every push or submission action.
